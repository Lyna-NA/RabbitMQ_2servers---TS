# Microservices Demo Project using RabbitMQ as a Message Broker

 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to implement microservices architecture 
 using RabbitMQ as a message broker.The project will showcase how to decouple components of a system
 and allow them to communicate with each other asynchronously through message queues.


 The project will consist of two microservices that will be deployed and run independently.
 Each microservice will have its own specific responsibility and will communicate with other microservices
 through RabbitMQ queues. The project will use the RabbitMQ messaging broker to facilitate communication between the different microservices.
